The USC RESL and ACT robotics research labs seek a student to design and build 
a system for charging over 100 small lithium-polymer batteries simultaneously.
This system will support our research with large swarms of micro-quadcopters.

The system is envisioned as a collection of identical PCB's drawing power
from a central DC power supply. The system will use off-the-shelf charging 
IC's, with an indicator LED for each battery, and appropriate connectors.

The candidate will be responsible for:
- Selecting parts and creating a bill of materials
- Designing the PCB in a CAD program
- Working directly with a PCB manufacturer
- Engineering the power distribution system to safely transmit 
  significant total DC current to the PCBs
- Final assembly and testing
- Assisting with design and fabrication of physical structure

This position requires a significant degree of autonomy.
The candidate must be able to complete the tasks listed above with only 
high-level guidance from the supervisor. Candidates who have successfully 
designed and manufactured a PCB in the past are preferred. 

Please send resume, brief cover letter, and sample of PCB layout work
to japreiss@usc.edu.
